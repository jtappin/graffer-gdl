GRAFFER
=======

Graffer is an interactive tool for generating plots of data and/or
functions. 

This is the original IDL/GDL version. The code was originally developed
in IDL, but recent improvements in the widgets on GDL mean that it is
now possible to use it in GDL as well.

The main capabilities:
Plotting X vs. Y data with optional error bars.
Plotting X vs. Y functions (including parametric functions).
Contour or colour displays of 2-D datasets and functions.

Testing and development has been on various Linux flavours. If you want
to try to use it on other systems, be prepared to do the porting work.

IMPORTANT: If you are using GDL you MUST use a recent GIT snapshot as
some critical widget bugs have been fixed since the 1.0.0 release.

There is also a Fortran version of the core tool that was originally
written to stress-test Gtk-Fortran.
